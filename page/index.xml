      <description>&lt;p&gt;Preet Singh is rumoured to know fourteen languages, eleven of them of his own invention. We can&amp;rsquo;t find any mention of him dating back more than five years, though, to be fair, our pizza arrived so we stopped looking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we do know is that he enjoys algorithmic strategy, writes code and occasionally calls himself a scientist because that impresses his niece. He received his undergraduate degree in Computer Science &amp;amp; Economics, and dropped out of a PhD in Algorithmic Economics. He has &lt;a href=&#34;http://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PnWHq3QAAAAJ&amp;amp;amp;hl=en&#34;&gt;research publications&lt;/a&gt; in algorithm design and multiagent systems AI, and hopes to one day have a research paper &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.journalofcryptozoology.com/&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
